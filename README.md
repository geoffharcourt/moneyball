# Moneyball

Moneyball parses MLB Gameday's play-by-play information to pull useful
quantitative and qualitative information out of the data feed. Moneyball can
determine where a batted ball was hit, the general classification of the batted
ball, and stat line information from the plate appearance.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'moneyball'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install moneyball

## Usage

`Moneyball::Parser` takes a Nokogiri XML node.

```ruby
raw_xml = '<atbat event="Strikeout" des="Ty Cobb strikes out swinging."></atbat>'
nokogiri_node = Nokogiri::XML(raw_xml).search("atbat").first
stats = Moneyball::Parser.new(nokogiri_node).stats

stats.slice(:pa, :ab, :h, :k) # => { pa: 1, ab: 1, h: 0, k: 1 }
```

`Moneyball::BattedBallLocationExtractor` and `Moneyball::BattedBallTypeExtractor` take a string from the play-by-play summary.

```ruby
summary = "Billy Hamilton hits a fly ball home run (22) to deep center field."
Moneyball::BattedBallTypeExtractor.new(summary).categorize # => "Line drive"
Moneyball::BattedBallLocationExtractor.new(summary).categorize # => "CF"
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
